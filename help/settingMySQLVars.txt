If you need to set a system variable for the MySQL server, it's done by adding a name-value pair in a file called my.cnf.  MySQL will look inside the /etc for the my.cnf file.  This file does not exist by default.  The following steps describe how to create the my.cnf file used to configure MySQL.

step 1. log in to mysql.  Fire up the terminal and enter:
$MYSQL -u root -p

Step 2. view MYSQL's current values:
show variables;
check the value of the variable you want to change

step 3. Create  /etc/my.cnf:
sudo vim /etc/my.cnf

and add (for example):
[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len=3

to the file and save.

Step 4: Restart MYSQL servers using MAMP

Step 5: Login to MYSQL again and check the variable has changed
